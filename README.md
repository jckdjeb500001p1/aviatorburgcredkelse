## How to Play Aviator

Aviator is a very simple game to play. The goal of the game is to cash
out your bet before the plane flies away.

To play Aviator, you first need to choose a bet amount. You can bet as
little as 1 INR or as much as 100,000 INR.

Once you have chosen your bet amount, you need to click the "Bet"
button. The plane will then take off and start flying.

The plane will continue to fly until it either flies away or crashes. If
the plane flies away, you will lose your bet. If the plane crashes, you
will win a payout.

The payout amount is determined by the multiplier that is displayed on
the screen. The multiplier will increase as the plane flies higher.

You can cash out your bet at any time by clicking the "Cash Out"
button. If you cash out before the plane crashes, you will win a payout
equal to the multiplier that is displayed on the screen.
